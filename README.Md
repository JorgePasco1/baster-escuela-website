### Virtual env

Creating a virtual environment is recommended to avoid overwriting global installs of this project's dependencies.

To create a virtual env, create a `venv` folder inside the project's directory, and activate it, as follows:

```
python3 -m venv env
. venv/bin/activate
```

### Installing requirements

Then, install the requirements with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
